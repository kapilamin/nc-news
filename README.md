# Northcoders News API
As part of *Northcoder's Skills Bootcamp in Software Development*, we were tasked with building a RESTful news API backend which can provide information to my other [frontend project](https://github.com/M1nhnho/fe-nc-news). This API will allow clients to access articles, grouped under topics, along with comments and the users behind them - akin to Reddit or similar news services.

This backend project follows the MVC pattern and was built in JavaScript using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to enable easier server routing and error handling. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) was used for the databases and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) for TDD. Moreover, a CI/CD pipeline has been implemented through Github Actions to ensure tests pass before merging any pull requests.

## Hosted version
My backend project along with the available endpoints can be found here (may take a minute to load initially):  
https://nc-news-452q.onrender.com/api

The online database is hosted via [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) whereas the API is hosted via [Render](https://render.com/).

## Local setup
If you wish to run this backend project locally, ensure you fulfill the requirements below before following the instructions.

### Minimum Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v20.11.0)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v14.9)

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the directory you wish to download the repository to
2. Run the following commands inside the terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kapilamin/nc-news.git
    ```
3. Navigate into the newly created `be-nc-news` directory
4. Run the following command to install all the needed dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
5. You may need to start your PostgreSQL server if it hasn't already
6. Run the following command inside the terminal to create your local databases:
    ```
    npm run setup-dbs
    ```
7. Create the following 2 files inside the root directory:
    - `.env.test`
    - `.env.development`
8. Add the following single line to each file: `PGDATABASE=<database_name>`
9. Replace `<database_name>` with the appropriate name (these can be found in the `/db/setup.sql` file)
10. Run the following command inside the terminal to test everything has been set up correctly:
    ```
    npm t
    ```
11. If everything passes, you are free to play around as you wish 😊
